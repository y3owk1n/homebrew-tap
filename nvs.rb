	def caveats
	<<~EOS
		nvs stores its downloaded versions, cache, and configuration in OS-specific directories.

		On macOS by default:
		• Configuration: ~/.config/nvs
		• Cache:         ~/.cache/nvs
		• Global binary symlink: ~/.local/bin

		You can override these defaults by setting the following environment variables:
		• NVS_CONFIG_DIR – to change the configuration directory.
		• NVS_CACHE_DIR  – to change the cache directory.
		• NVS_BIN_DIR    – to change the global binary directory.

		To completely remove nvs and all its data, please manually delete the relevant directories.
